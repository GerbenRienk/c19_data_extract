# c19_data_extract

This repository will be used to create a script that will extract data from an odk-aggregate-server, version 2.0.5.
For this we will send requests to the api with two end-points: /view/submissionList and /view/downloadSubmission

I built further on the answers that were kindly provided on https://forum.getodk.org/t/authentication-to-odk-via-python/2224/6
